## The Question Report
I created a question report that contains a collection of all datapointsthat raised questions. 
The missing values and strange values like 0 "unitprice" are saved in seperate csv files. 
A report was created where you can find the different csv files, the total number of data points where the missing data is appearing and  to what percentage the missing data occure in the whole dataset.
The report could be handed to the company that e.g. a VC considers to aquire or could be discussed directly with the responsible person. So that all questions can be answered before taking further actions.
